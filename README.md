# ARTH Team Task 1
###Now a days, we all live in the age of Technology. There are various technologies that are repeatedly used by students and software engineers everyday. 

###Also, most of the technologies require special knowledge for their execution. But what if we can create a tool, where we can operate these technologies within a few clicks, without even having to know any of their operations!

###In order to achieve this, our ARTH Team has created an automation tool in Python, wherein you can install, configure, execute and manage various technologies like Hadoop, Apache Web Server, Docker, AWS and Partition creation and management, that too without knowing or typing a single line of code!
